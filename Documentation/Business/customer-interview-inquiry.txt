Hello!

I hope you are doing well. My name is Matthew Fonken from the local tech startup, Marbl Limited. Iâ€™m hoping to connect with local architects and designers to learn about and gain perspectives on the current state of 3D modeling and design. My company is very early stage focused on computer peripheral development with a potentially significant advancement in 3D design tool technology.

If possible, I would love to talk/meet with any willing team-members of Neenan Archistruction who have experience in 3D software/design to hear their stories and perspectives. Anything from a quick email to meeting over coffee with whoever is interested.

Thank you for your time and best regard,
Matthew Fonken
